The referee is entirely correct that our Bayesian analysis is not
necessarily limited by the C-R bound.  However, we discuss the Fisher
information matrix at this point in the manuscript because it
illustrates the amount of information contained in each data point,
not to place rigirous bounds on the posterior uncertainty.  We have
added a sentence to make this distinction clear just before Eq. (48).

This was to mark changes for referee A, and has now been removed from
the text.

Done.  Thank you for the suggestion.

We have replaced the single figure 9 with two figures, which makes the
plots and labels much more readable.

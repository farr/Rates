Dear Editor:

This is a response to the referee report on our manuscript DB11163 by Farr et al.

We apologize for the very delayed response.  We are grateful to the referee for a thorough reading of the manuscript and a number of very useful comments.  We have incorporated the suggestions of the referee.  The text in bold represents the changes that have been made relative to the initial submission.  We also describe specific changes inline below.

Whatever the units of f and \hat{f} [which depends on the space in which the corresponding rate density is measured], R_f provides the overall scaling amplitude in Eq. 9 and is therefore dimensionless (and similarly for R_b).  We have added a comment to this effect in the text.

Indeed, (18) and (21) are the two key equations; which one is used depends on whether the marginalized probability distributions associated with individual events are of interest.  We have added a new paragraph to the introduction (penultimate paragraph) to highlight these equations.

We have replaced $f_i$ with $g_i$.

Reworded.

We clarified the text.

Typos fixed.

This is indeed a very interesting question that has attracted much debate in the gravitational-wave data analysis community in recent months.  Whether to remove foreground candidates (those coincident in zero lag, prior to time slides) before performing slides depends on whether a conservative estimate or a more accurate estimate is warranted.  We decided to leave this discussion out of the present paper.

Revised.

Figure expanded to make the axes more clear.

We are indeed planning a follow-up paper that would tackle some of the practical issues raised by the referee, such as background estimates.  As this paper is focused on the statistical framework, and gravitational-wave data analysis is just one of the examples, we have resisted the urge to go into too many details here.

As described around Eq. (54), we only record the loudest event (the one which best matches the template)  at any given time.

>> 11. It is stated that Neff is a property of the background

We clarified this to say that it is a property of the distribution of background events identified by filtering with this template bank. 

>> 12. It is stated that they used the same dataset as sec. V.A, with the

There was no filtering as such in either example â€” the background distribution was constructed by drawing template SNRs as described around Eq. (55).  In the example of section V.B, only N_eff templates were used to construct the background distribution.


We have also added a new reference, [8] in the present revision.
